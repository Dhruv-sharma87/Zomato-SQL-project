# Zomato-SQL-project
* This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data using SQL.
* The dataset includes restaurant names, ratings, votes, approximate costs, online ordering availability, and dining types.
* Data distribution was analyzed to find the most common restaurant types.
* Average cost per restaurant type was determined to understand pricing trends.
* Many high-rated restaurants have low votes, indicating they are new or less marketed.
* Online ordering is widely available, but fewer restaurants offer table booking.
* Luxury restaurants donâ€™t always have high ratings, highlighting service issues.
* Some budget restaurants receive high ratings, proving quality service matters more than price.
* Various business insights were extracted to help customers, restaurant owners, and food delivery platform.
